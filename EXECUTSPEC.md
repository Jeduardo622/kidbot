# KidBot Executive Specification

## Vision
**KidBot** is a creative, safe, and voice-driven AI playground for children ages **4–12**.  
It helps kids explore curiosity through stories, science experiments, and artistic expression — all guided by a friendly voice persona they can talk to.

KidBot combines **OpenAI’s Apps SDK** (for in-ChatGPT UI & interaction) and **Agents SDK + Realtime API** (for voice orchestration and creative reasoning).

---

## Mission Statement
Empower kids to *learn through play* by interacting with a trusted digital friend that nurtures imagination, encourages safe exploration, and promotes early STEM curiosity.

## Core Features (v1.0 Scope)
| Feature | Description | SDK / Tech |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| **1. Voice Chat + Voice Persona** | Conversational voice chat with friendly characters (Robot, Fairy, Explorer). Uses OpenAI **Realtime API** for speech synthesis and recognition. | Realtime API + Agents SDK |
| **2. Slow-Motion Comic Panels / Storyboards** | Kids generate visual stories as panels with captions and evolving plots. | Apps SDK UI + Agents SDK |
| **3. Live Coloring Book** | Dynamic outline images kids can color in with touch or stylus directly inside ChatGPT. | Apps SDK (component) + Canvas API |
| **4. Science / Experiment Simulator** | Safe, household experiments with predictions and explanations (STEM learning). | Agents SDK (structured reasoning) |
| **5. Parental Dashboard (future)** | Parent summary of child’s activity and learning topics. | Backend + Secure OAuth |

## Audience Segmentation
| Age Band | Tone & Complexity | Example Activities |
|-----------|------------------|--------------------|
| **4–6 (Early Learners)** | Simple words, big visuals, short sentences. | Voice chat, coloring, basic “why” questions. |
| **7–9 (Curious Minds)** | Slightly more text, early experiments. | Story creation, comics, light science. |
| **10–12 (Explorers)** | Deeper reasoning, structured projects. | Multi-panel storytelling, creative challenges. |

---

## Safety & Compliance
- **COPPA** / **GDPR-K** aligned: no data collection beyond necessary app function.
